I get back from a job to find her car parked, keys locked inside the house and a couple of suitcases gone  Not answering her phone, I drove around a few of our friends paces and to her old job - no sign of her anywhere  Fast forward two weeks, still no communication apart from a very generic message to a couple of mutual friends, so I've all but given up any hope of resolution through communication  My question is; what the hell am I supposed to do at this stage?

my life is pretty tumultuous and my issues deal with some stuff that people in the group find triggering and want nothing to do with or to hear about, and a mod told me so explicitly after multiple people had approached them (though they have a tagging system in place and i used it accordingly, except one girl thought it was ‘too much hassle’ to check first and other people supposedly agreed, which kind of nullifies the whole purpose of the tagging system if you ask me… it was far from the only thing i talked about, but it was usually where i turned when i was desperately in need of someone to talk to- and i know that was wrong of me, because hotlines exist for that- but i just, i dont know, i thought they were my friends and they knew the situation and i didnt have it in me to explain from scratch to a hotline operator when i was on the verge of relapsing, you know?

and i dont mind not talking about that sort of thing- but they went on to say i should stop talking about my special interests: and i’m working on not mini monologing one on one, (hard to believe from this, i know) but it stung immensely because i have issues with communicating to people and emotional attachment issues (contributed in part by poor socialization with peers, a lifetime of intense physical / emotional / mental and sexual abuse, relentless racial and appearance based bullying,) and… they were aware of that?
Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
